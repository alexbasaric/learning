When a man who doesn't know what he wants meets a woman who does, such an encounter inevitably ends in marriage. 

Today will be a good day for anyone who isn't expecting much. 

Store your health somewhere safe; far from work and family
 
 Winter is coming. You're going to need either gloves or someone's hand. 

 What's little to us can be a lot to those who don't even have a little. 

The rain fell and poured and sprayed and gushed... it's done everything but stop.

Here we are again, at the beginning. Today we'll again practice the complete programme of life; to be ready for when we eventually start living. 

 There are some women who only love their husbands. Those husbands are nothing special, but those women are. 

 A new day is born. All of Belgrade has woken up to see it. Congratulate one another. You have rejoiced in smaller successes. 

Flirt with your wife a little - as if she wasn't your wife, as if she didn't love you, as if she had another, as if she had a choice. And your wife will not be ungrateful. She will respond to this attention with much kindness - as if she loved you, as if she didn't have another, as if she had no choice. 

A lot, that's a little every day. 

 If school's not going well, get married. If you can't find work, have a baby. Smaller problems are effectively solved by bigger ones. 

  Yesterday, a father at a school parent's evening lost his temper: Give me a good child, and you'll see what a good father I am! 



 In Zemun, on the shores of the Danube, quality fish soup is being prepared. To get to the soup you should: go to the centre of Zemun, then follow the scent from there. 

 Too little money is bad for the body and too much is bad for the soul. People have a real dilemma. What are they supposed to keep their soul in if they spoil their body? And what are they supposed to keep in a healthy body if they are left without a soul?  


(43) A certain Jelena from the 5th Secondary School of Belgrade has finally found a boyfriend. She asked him, "Who are you?" and he answered clearly, "I am your boyfriend."

(44) Delight your feet! Wash them or change your socks. Wash your feet! That is the first prerequisite for good interpersonal relations!

(45) Nije teško biti toliko nesrećan da bi čovek počeo da pije. Ljude treba odvikavati od nesreće, a ne od alkohola. Nesreća je veći porok

48) Neki ljudi nas ponižavaju svojom dobrotom. Odvikli smo se od dobrote. Ne razumemo zašto nam neko nešto čini ako ne traži nikakvu protivuslugu. Dobrota se ne može vratiti jer se i ne daje. Dobri ljudi su dobri zbog sebe, a ne zbog drugih.


(50) Pre nego što krenete da tražite sreću, proverite - možda ste već srećni. Sreća je mala, obična i neupadljiva i mnogi ne umeju da je vide.
(50) Before you start looking for happiness, check - maybe you already have it. Happiness is small, ordinary and inconspicuous and many are unable to see it. 


(52) Moglo bi nam biti mnogo bolje kad to ne bi zavisilo od nas. Na zalost, sva briga o nama prepustena je nama. Dakle, najgore moguce resenje. Zbog toga sa ogorcenjem mozemo reci - nismo to zasluzili.


(54) Nasmesite se, sa mnogo dobrote i malo, malo gorcine. Oprostite zivotu i svetu sto nisu savrseni.
(54) Smile, with plenty of goodness and only a little bitterness. Forgive life and the world for not being perfect. 

 Yesterday, many drivers had the good fortune of avoiding any traffic misfortune. 

  Could people be better? They could, but nobody wants to be the first to start. 
 
 Yesterday, a father and daughter met up and agreed: If she stopped smoking, he'd buy her a car. And if she stopped drinking, he'd buy her a driving license as well. 

Sleeping we do nothing else. Sleeping's cheap. Sleeping we pose no threat to anyone else. But as soon as we wake up, like it or not, we have to do something else. And that's when a whole bunch of unnecessary problems start.

If you want to be right all the time, you have to change your mind a lot. 

Why should a man divorce? Primarily because he is married, followed by some other reasons. 

It is a new day. Everyone has been offered the opportunity to do something for themselves or against everyone else. 

We overheard a woman cursing a taxi driver this morning: I hope that your electricity meter runs the same as your taxi meter. 

Like every morning, Old Belgrade has set off into New Belgrade, and vice versa. The bridges are packed with cars. Both think it is better on the other side. Once they confirm that it is not, they will return to where they came from.
