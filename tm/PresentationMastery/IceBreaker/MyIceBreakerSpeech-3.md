Learning Never Ends

# About Me

Thank you Madame Toastmaster and good afternoon fellow toastmasters. 

My name is Alex (Basaric), I have joined toastmasters few months ago, after coming to few meetings as a guest. I'd like to thank Liliya for encouraging me to sign up officially, so thank you Lilia. 

I put my name for this speech a few weeks ago, then immediately started worrying what am I going to talk about and how it will go? So I spent way too much time thinking about that, searching the web etc, getting really nervous. 

Then finally I found an article on toastmaster online magazine titled "How To Survive your first Ice Breaker", so I thought, "yes, that's exactly what I need‚Äù ... to give this speech and stay alive after that. So, I read the article, here I am.

## Early Years

I was born and raised in Serbia, which was part of Yugoslavia at that time. Soon after finishing my studies in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia split into several smaller countries, unfortunately not very peacefully. Together with the bad economic situation it motivated many a young person, me included, to leave the country. 


## Coming to Canada

I came to Canada in early 90-s, on May 2nd 1992, to be precise, exactly 2 years, to the day, after a former colleague of mine. I called him the next day, he helped me prepare my resume, and I landed an interview at Spar Aerospace, where he was working at the time. It helped that we both had the opportunity to learn Unigraphics, at the company that we worked together for a short time in Serbia. Unigraphics is a Computer Aided Design software, widely used in aerospace, automotive and other industries.

A couple of years later another opportunity opened itself up in a small automotive parts manufacturing company, called Master Precision, a division of Magna International. One of the clients was Chrysler, which uses different CAD software, called Catia. So I learned that too, and when Boing published few ads in the Star, (yes people were reading careers sections of printed papers at the time and sending applications by mail!), I sent the application, and few months later moved to Seattle. 

## Seattle
I spent about year and a half in Seattle, as was my initial plan, although being laid off helped to make quick decision to leave üòä. Aviation industry is known for being very cyclical, so they do mass firing just the same as they did mass hiring. I was contemplating my return to Toronto where I had friends, and my sister and parents moved recently as well.

## Back to Toronto - second career
After coming back to Toronto, I decided to try and switch to a computer programming career. Programming was a bit of a passion for me, ever since high school. So while I was in Seattle, I took few of the free evening courses that Boing was offering in various subjects, including some in Java.
Once back in Toronto, I took a couple of Java certifications exams, and it wasn‚Äôt hard to find a job as Java developer.  
Most of the early 2000's I was working for a small startup in the real estate listing management business.  

Then, about 10 years ago, I joined Tarion. 

Most of my 'second career' jobs were developing web applications using so called Java Enterprise Edition. There were lots of different technologies and tools to pick up and learn along the way, different databases, application servers, design and development methodologies, and so on.

And these days, Tarion is moving everything to Salesforce, and the cloud ‚Äì more fun and learning for everybody. Even next week I have a course in Platform Application Development.

So, in the end it is nothing but an endless learning journey for me, and I am verry happy for that. Otherwise, life would be too boring, wouldn‚Äôt it?

Thank you all, back to you Madame toastmaster.
