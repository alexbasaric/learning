Speech Title

# About Me

Thank you MS or Mr toastmaster (or whoever introduces me).

Good afternoon fellow toastmasters. My name is Alex (Basaric), I have joined toastmasters few months ago, after coming to few meetings as a guest. I'd like to thank Liliya for encouraging me to sign up officially. 

I put my name for this speech few weeks ago, then started thinking what am I going to talk about? I spent way too much time thinking about that, searching the web etc. Then finally found an article on toastmaster online magazine titled "How To Survive your first Ice Breaker", so I thought, "yes, that's exactly what I need ... to give this speech and stay alive after that. So, I read the article, and it says, just make speech about yourself, so this is what I am going to do. 

## Early Years
I was born and raised in Serbia, which used to be part of Yugoslavia at that time. Soon after finishing studies in Mechanical Engineering at University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia split into several smaller countries, more or less on ethnical or religious fault lines. This resulted in several years of bloody wars, and an exodus of thousands of young people from all regions of once reasonably prosperous country. That may not have been main or only reason for me to move to Canada, but it certainly made the decision much easier. 

## Coming to Canada
I came to Canada in early 90-s, US and Canada were slowly coming out of recession at the time, and it was not very easy to get first job for most immigrants.
However, a colleague of mine, from my first job in Serbia, also mechanical engineer, happened to immigrate to Canada in 1990, exactly two years before me, to the date. So when I arrived, I called him and, to make a long story short, two weeks later I started working at Spar.

* -- if need to expand for time: 
I called him the next day, and he told me they might be hiring at Spar Aerospace, where he was working at the time. He told me to bring a resume and come to visit him. I asked, "bring a what?", then he explained that's how CV's are called here. *

The reason for quick placement was that, we worked in Serbia for a company that was using Unigraphichs, a professional Computer Aided Design software, and had a chance to learn it. Turns out that Unigraphics, which was developed by McDonnell Douglas is also widely used in aerospace, automotive and other industries.

I only stayed one year at Spar, because a better opportunity opened itself up in a small automotive parts manufacturing company, called Master Precision, a division of Magna International. One of the clients was Chrysler which happened to be using different CAD software developed by Dassault Syst√®mes called Catia. It wasn't too long before I became proficient in it, and when Boing published few ads in the Star, (yes people were reading careers sections of printed papers at the time!), I sent the application, and few months later moved to Seattle. 

## Seattle
I spent about year and a half in Seattle, before being laid off. Aviation industry being very cyclical it was not big surprise to me. I was contemplating 
 my return to Canada where I had friends, and family for few months anyway.

One thing I forgot to mention, computers were a bit of a passion for me since high school and I had interest in programming since my first programming course in high school, then followed by university course in Fortran, which I used little on my first job, back in Serbia too. So, during my time in Seatle, I took the opportunity to brush up on my skills.  You see, Boing was providing free training for employees, on their own time, in various subjects so I took a few programming courses, just for fun. Some of them were in Java programming language. 
ÔÅÆ	If need to expand ‚Äì C++ was ‚Äúthe‚Äù language at the time, Java in its infancy, but Java was easier to learn. üòä 

## Back to Toronto - second career

So, after coming back to Toronto, I decided to switch to a computer programming career. 
I spent the early 2000's mostly working for a company that was supporting Royal LePage database and web site, and later created their own real-estate agent/listings management product.

*-- if needed for time: 
 (maybe skip this) Unitil a former colleage of mine from University of Belgrade asked me via Linkedin to join him on a contract job for a Toronto based marketing company. Spent there a year or so, then joined Tarion in 2013.*

Then, about 10 year ago, I joined Tarion. 

## Conclussion

Most of my 'second career' jobs were developing web applications, front and back end, using so called Java Enterprise Edition. 
Until couple of years Tarion decides to move everything to Salesforce! Now this is, if nothing else, providing me yet another opportunity to challenge myself, and see if it is true, as Livia said in her presentation on Changes, last week, that there are new advances in the area of human brain functionality, and that it is indeed possible 'to tach an old dog a new trick'.
