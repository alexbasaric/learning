# Title - maybe something about challenges or changes
 - to follow up on Livia's last week presentation, and gives me opportunity to use nice conclusion

Godd afternoon fellow tostmasters. My name is Alex (Basaric), I have joined toastmasters few months ago, after coming to few meetings as a guest. I think I was in the office one Wednesday in June and you had first in-person, or hybrid meeting, after Covid, and I just walked in. I have to thank Liliya for encouraging me to join officially. 

Optional - I heard about Toastmasters actually about 30 year ago when I came to Canada, and was working at Spar Aerospace, but I have promptly forgot about it - why would I even mention this??
Next I heard of it in Tarion and was on couple of open house meetings but due to different reasons, didn't join untio this year. 



is being my first Ice Breaker speach and after spending way too much time think about what am I going to talk about, I finally found an article on toastmaster online magazine titled "How To Surviwe your first Ice Breakar". I immediately recognized that's me - that's what I want, I just want to give this speach and "survive", that's my one only goal! So the article says that I shall make it all about me, and that's exaclty what I will do.

I was born in Novi Sad, second largest city of Serbia, which used to be part of Yugoslavia at that time. 

My father is retired mechanical engineer and my mother retired acounting clerk.

My parents are from northern part of Serbia, called Vojvodina, which is absolutlely flat, basically farmland, comparable to Manitoba or Saskatchevan, of course couple of orders of magnitued smaller. 

This part of the world is becoming increasinbly famous because Nikola Jokic, a baskedball player from Denver, is from around there, he is from Sombor, and my parents from Becej. 

For couple of years I lived in Becej, where my parents are from, and where my father had to work to satisfy conditions of a stipend that he was receiving for his studies. He is retired mechanical engineer. 



- expand if need to fill time. I only lived few months there though, since my parents already lived in Belgrade. My dad went to compulsury military service few days after I was born, so my mom went to her mom and sister to Novi Sad to give birth and stay few months there.

However, I grew up really in Belgrade. Soon after finishing studies in Mechanical Engineering, the Yugoslavia split into several smaller countries, more or less, etnical grounds, that triggered several years of bloody wars. If that was not the main or only reason for decision to come to Canada, it at least made the decision easier. 

So I came to canada in early 90-s. US and Canada were slowly coming out of recession at that time... expand if need to fill time
How I got my first job is interesting story. A coleagu of mine from my first job in Serbia, also mechanical engineer, happed to immigrate to Canada in 1990, on May 2nd. Exactly two years after him, on 2-May-1992, I came to Canada. I called him the next day, and he told me they might be hiring at Spar Aerospace, where he was working at the time. He told me to bring a resume and come to visith him. I asked "bring a what?", then he explaind that's how CV's are called here. Anyway to make long story short, two weeks later I started working at Spar. 
I only stayed one year at Spar, because better opportunity opened itself in a small automotive parts manufacturing company, called Master Precision, which was division of Magna International. 
After spending few years there, I got an opportunity to move to Seattle, where I worked for Boing, for about a year and a half.

Forgot to mention that my jobs in those years was as mechanical design engineer. Basically, doing Computer Aided Design, of mechanical parts for aerospace and automotive industries.

Living in Seattle maybe I will talk about next time. 

After coming back, I decided to try and switch to a computer programming career. Flashback - I has always affinity for programming, as a high school student I even visited a lab and so punched cards in action. And at University we had a course in Fortran, which I happened to have used on my first job. 
Fast forward to late 90-s in Seattle, Boing provided free training for employees, on their own time, in various subjects. Similar to Percipio courses offered by Tarion, but at that time everyghing was in person of cours. I took the opportunity to take few progarmming courses, just for fun. Some of them were in Java programming language, which proved very useful in making a career change. 

I spend early 2000's mostly workign for a company that was supporting Royal LePage and later created their own real-estate agent/listings management businss. 
 (maybe skip this) Unitil a former colleage of mine from University of Belgrade asked me via Linkedin to join him on a contract job for a Toronto based marketing company. Spent there a year or so, then joined Tarion in 2013.

Conclussion:


 Most of my 'second career' jobs were developing web applications, front and back end, using so called Java Enterprise Edition. 
 Until, couple of years Tarion decedes to move everything to Salesforce! Now this will, if nothing else, provide me with another opportunity to challenge myself, and see if it is true, as Livia said in her wonderful presentation last week, that there are new learnings in the area of human brain functionality, and that it actually possible 'to tach an old dog a new trick'
