This could possibly be my next speech.

Introduction - explain how Toasmasters inspired me to make a summary about Salesforce training, certification and career paths, which I struggled for long time.
Now I decided to kill two birds with one stone - choose a suitable course and give a TM speech!! 
Maybe I will even publish this on my yet to be developed blog.

# Something about how to choose training and certification path

https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/career-path
- took the quiz which recommended Salesforce Architect for me 
    - Top Skills In This Role: Application Management, Cloud Computing, Teaching, Software Development, Quality Assurance, Marketing Software

https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/credentials/administratoroverview/

## Start with choosing your profile

There is 7 roles offered, each with set of recommended certifications
- Administrator
- Architect
- Developer
- Sales Professional
- Marketer
- Consultant
- Designer

More information about each role and certification can be found on Salesforce "Trailhead" website. 
TODO explain what Trailhead is
- https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/credentials/consultantoverview/

To me two roles appeal the most, that of Salesforce Developer and Architect

Currently there are 8 different Developer credentials, which I narrowed to 3 or 4 that potentially are of interest to me:
- JavaScript Developer I
  - front and/or back-end JavaScript apps for the web-stack, including Lightning Web Components
- Platform App Builder
  - focused on declarative customization capabilities of SF
- Platform Developer I and II 
  - customizing using programmatic capabilities of Lightning Platform, including Apex and Visualforce, data modeling for developing complex business logic and interfaces
The remaining 4 are more specialized:
- B2C Commerce Developer
- Industries CPQ Developer
- Marketing Cloud Developer
- OmniStudio Developer

TODO Convert below into a TABLE, add column recommended hours, and hours left for me - Explain that there are many overlapping training "units" (trails or badges inside trailmixes)
TODO Explain structure of training units - trailmixes vs trails vs badges vs Modules

# Salesforce Developer

# Architect

Salesforce offers several distinct certifications at architect level. 

## Technical Architect

Highest certification is "Technical Architect" for which comprises Technical Architect and
Solution Architect designations plus a successful evaluation by the Architect Review Board, and the Architect Review Board Exam.

See diagrams on [salesforce trailhead web site](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/credentials/architectoverview/) for more details.

For now, I am keeping in mind that certification path for this starts with following "entry" level certifications:
- Platform Developer I
- Platform App Builder


## Solution Architect

Solution Architects are divided into B2B and B2C compartments. 
For now, I'll note that the prerequisites are:
- Platform App Builder,
- Platform Developer I
- Data Architect
- Sharing and Visibility Architect and
- Integration Architect



After reviewing the above maze of career roles and certification paths, I narrowed down, for myself two certifications as equally good starting points:
- Platform App Builder
- Platform Developer I
