O evo ovde ima objasnjenje i baš vrendost sile za brij 6

In other words: A DIN setting of 6 equates to a release force at the toe of 185N, at the heel of 741 N. Using a BSL (boot sole length) of 300mm, that equates to a torque of 55.5 N-m for a toe release and 222 N-m for a heel release. A longer or shorter boot will not change the force of a DIN 6 setting, but it will change the torque required to release.

Evo ovo je isto dobar savet, neko kaze od pre 4 decenije savet iz ski magazine :)

I still occasionally use the old method I read about in a ski magazine 4+ decades back.

Toe Piece. Click your boot in. You should be able to punch it out to the side.

Click you boot in and have someone stand on the back of your ski, heavy couch or something works. Then lunge forward . You should be able to lunge out, just not too easily. Probably a recipe for disaster, but, yeah, I do that.

E ovo je isto super, instrukcike iz Look manuals

SELF-RELEASE PROCEDURE
Follow the procedure below with the skier’s boot fully buckled (as it is during skiing) and engaged in the ski binding.
1. Setting the Heelpiece:
a. Have the skier stand on one foot.
b. The ski should not be restrained.
c. Instruct the skier to release the heelpiece by bending their
lower leg forward. (Move knee forward and down, toward the forebody of the ski). Do not lunge forward with the opposite leg. This will cause undesirable upward pulling on the Achilles tendon.
d. Readjust the setting to the skier’s comfort threshold.
2. Setting the Toepiece:
a. Have the skier place the ski on its inside edge, by rolling the lower leg inward.
b. Then slowly twist the foot inward. Rapid twisting should be avoided.
c. Readjust the setting to the skier’s comfort threshold.
3. Document on the work ticket the final setting and have the skier
initial the for
