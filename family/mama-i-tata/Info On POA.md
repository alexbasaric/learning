## Bing - Can I write POA for personal care myself and have signed by a notary or I have to hire a lawyer

A Power of Attorney for Personal Care is a legal document that allows you to appoint someone to make decisions about your personal care if you become unable to do so yourself. You can write your own POA for personal care as long as you follow the requirements of the law and your wishes are clear and specific. However, it is advisable to consult a lawyer before signing your POA for personal care, as they can help you avoid any potential errors or disputes that may arise in the future. A lawyer can also advise you on the best way to execute your POA for personal care, such as whether you need a notary public or witnesses to sign it. According to one web source, a notary public is not required for a POA for personal care in Ontario, but you need two witnesses who are not your spouse, children, or attorney1. However, the rules may vary depending on your province or territory, so it is best to check with a lawyer or a legal service provider in your area. Here are some web links that may help you write your own POA for personal care:
